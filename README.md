# presentation-routing

## Managing networking chaos while migrating to AWS multi-account architecture
Presentation about **just one possible** way of routing while migrating from a monolith to multi-account.

Originally had more information about Terraform resources, but was simplified to correlate it more with costs.

Wish I had more than few days to think of subject and prepare the whole thing. 

But as a first presentation for 50+ engineers it wasn't bad I hope :bowtie:
